This program was made by me to practice and figure out the basics of the SFML framework, how the mouse operates with objects created and how every iteration of a frame works to move said objects in the window created. 
This program could serve as an aim trainer for FPS games as the entities move very fast in a vertical manner.

Regulations of the game:
If you don't maintain a score >0 above for 4 seconds, you lose and the application closes. Also, holding the mouse button won't work, I've added a boolean check that goes through every for loop of the click's detection and the boolean stays true unless you let go of LMB.
